## Setup

- Fork the repo
- Deploy it
  - Set SITE_LOCATION env variable to the URL which will be shared with others
  - Set DB_CONNECTION env variable, pointing to an SQLite database
  - Set USERNAME env variable, which will be used to login the first time
- Customise CSS in src/assets/custom.css

## How following works

- From the /follow page
- Enter someone's url which sends them a request with our url and a secret key
- Their site confirms from our /url/check and gets our profile name and image
- If they approve, their site sends us a message and we can then login on their site with the secret key
- Any posts they make will be sent to us with the secret key and saved into our database
