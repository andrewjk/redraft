An experiment.

Social media Ã— blogs Ã— newsletters

ðŸš§ WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

- Fully self-hostable
- All your data in a single file that you can take anywhere
- Make short status posts, or lengthy article posts
- Follow anyone and/or be followed by anyone with their own site
- Comment, like, react

## Setup

### Recommended

Use `npm` (or your preferred package manager) to create the template site:

```bash
npm init @redraft/site my-social
cd my-social
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Customise CSS in /src/assets/custom.css
- Set environment variables in a `.env` file for dev and in your production environment
  - Set `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`, which will be used to setup your account
  - Set `SITE_LOCATION` to the URL which will be shared with others
  - Set `DB_CONNECTION`, pointing to an SQLite database
  - Set `JWT_SECRET` to a random passphrase for encrypting your user token
- Run `npm run dev` to create the database
- Deploy the site
- Go to SITE_LOCATION/account/setup to create your account
- Regularly run `npm update`

### Full customization

ðŸš§ WARNING: THIS WILL NEED CONSTANT MAINTENANCE ðŸš§

- Fork the repo
- Tweak the code in /packages/site to your needs
- Customise CSS in /src/assets/custom.css
- Set environment variables in a `.env` file for dev and in your production environment
  - Set `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`, which will be used to setup your account

### Hosted

If the above sounds annoying, you can pay for a hosted account at https://redraft.social for $5 per month. At any time, you can take your data and move to a self-hosted solution.

## How following works

- From the /follow page
- Enter someone's url which sends them a request with our url and a secret key
- Their site confirms from our /url/check and gets our profile name and image
- If they approve, their site sends us a message and we can then login on their site with the secret key
- Any posts they make will be sent to us with the secret key and saved into our database
