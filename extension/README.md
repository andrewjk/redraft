# Redraft Web Extension

This extension allows you to browse and interact with Redraft sites around the web.

## How it works

Press the Redraft icon to open the extension and login to your account.

When visiting a site that runs on Redraft, you will be shown a `Follow` button that will send a follow request.

When visiting a site belonging to someone you already follow, the extension will add an authentication header enabling you to interact with their site (e.g. you will be able to add comments).

## Privacy

This extension does not transmit any information outside of your browser, your Redraft site and the sites of users you are following.

It stores a list of the people you are following and the secret keys that you share.

# Build
